- summary: Reset Ralph artifacts for v2 scope; replaced PRD, prompt, and progress baseline; added dedicated gameplay design document.
- decisions: Keep old work archived instead of deleting history; move to a stricter vertical-slice definition-of-done focused on combat + crafting + placement + polished UI.

- item: RLP2-101
- summary: Completed enemy visibility path by wiring combat snapshots through replication into Bevy and rendering snapshot-driven enemy actors in-world with live despawn/update behavior.
- decisions: Keep server-authoritative combat state unchanged; client now treats enemies as render-only entities sourced from validated combat snapshots so existing projectile combat can target the visible positions.
