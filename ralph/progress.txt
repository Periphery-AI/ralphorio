# Ralph Loop Progress (v2 Continuation)

This file is session memory for iterative Ralph runs.

Continuation note:
- Previous v1 progress has been archived at `ralph/progress.archive.v1-2026-02-11.txt`.
- This v2 track builds on already-implemented multiplayer/gameplay systems and prioritizes stabilization + fun.

- timestamp: 2026-02-11
- item: RLP2-000
- summary: Reset Ralph artifacts for v2 scope; replaced PRD, prompt, and progress baseline; added dedicated gameplay design document.
- decisions: Keep old work archived instead of deleting history; move to a stricter vertical-slice definition-of-done focused on combat + crafting + placement + polished UI.

- timestamp: 2026-02-11
- item: RLP2-101
- summary: Completed enemy visibility path by wiring combat snapshots through replication into Bevy and rendering snapshot-driven enemy actors in-world with live despawn/update behavior.
- decisions: Keep server-authoritative combat state unchanged; client now treats enemies as render-only entities sourced from validated combat snapshots so existing projectile combat can target the visible positions.

- commit: 7dc82dc

- timestamp: 2026-02-11
- item: RLP2-102
- summary: Implemented authoritative placement validation feedback by reusing server placement rules for preview and placement commands, then surfacing `canPlace` + failure reason through protocol parsing into the in-room HUD and status/dev log.
- decisions: Kept existing authoritative placement/persistence flow and structure replication intact; added a single shared worker validation path (`evaluate_structure_placement`) so preview validity and actual placement rejection reasons stay aligned.
- files: worker/src/lib.rs, src/game/types.ts, src/game/network-client.ts, src/routes/room-route.tsx, game-client/src/lib.rs, ralph/progress.txt

- commit: d8adabf

- timestamp: 2026-02-11
- item: RLP2-102
- summary: Hardened placement consistency by extracting shared structure-cell availability checks and adding focused worker regression tests for blocked/allowed placement cells, then validated full worker + web build loops and closed the PRD item.
- decisions: Kept existing authoritative placement command and replication architecture; only refactored collision gating into a pure helper (`structure_cell_is_available`) to improve testability without rewriting build/inventory systems.

- validation: cargo test --manifest-path worker/Cargo.toml (pass, 26 tests); cargo test --manifest-path sim-core/Cargo.toml (pass, 13 tests); npm run wasm:build:dev (pass); npm run build:web (pass)
- commit: pending

- timestamp: 2026-02-11
- item: RLP2-103
- summary: Removed the inventory-to-crafting gameplay blocker by adding direct in-game crafting controls (hotkeys queue/cancel authoritative crafting commands) and surfacing those controls in the room HUD so mined resources can immediately progress into craft outputs for building/combat recipes.
- decisions: Built on the existing server-authoritative crafting queue + build-cost consumption flow in the worker; no subsystem rewrites. Implemented client-side control wiring in Bevy (`crafting.queue` and `crafting.cancel`) and only added lightweight UI discoverability in `src`.
- files: game-client/src/lib.rs, src/routes/room-route.tsx, ralph/prd.json, ralph/progress.txt
- validation: cargo test --manifest-path worker/Cargo.toml (pass, 26 tests); cargo test --manifest-path sim-core/Cargo.toml (pass, 13 tests); npm run wasm:build:dev (pass); npm run build:web (pass)
- commit: pending

- timestamp: 2026-02-11
- item: RLP2-104
- summary: Reduced room HUD clutter by replacing the always-on multi-panel overlay with a compact tabbed command deck (inventory/crafting/build/telemetry), adding explicit minimize/show controls, and moving deep telemetry out of the top bar while keeping gameplay-critical information immediately accessible.
- decisions: Treated this as a focused UI slice on the existing room HUD architecture only (no subsystem rewrite); kept authoritative data surfaces unchanged and prioritized world visibility plus mobile-friendly panel switching over adding new panels.
